	year	= {2009},
	month	= may,
	pages	= {1--8},
	abstract= {The graphics processing unit (GPU) has emerged as a computational accelerator that dramatically reduces the time to discovery in high-end computing (HEC). However, while today's state-of-the-art GPU can easily reduce the execution time of a parallel code by many orders of magnitude, it arguably comes at the expense of significant power and energy consumption. For example, the NVIDIA GTX 280 video card is rated at 236 watts, which is as much as the rest of a compute node, thus requiring a 500-W power supply. As a consequence, the GPU has been viewed as a ldquonon-greenrdquo computing solution. This paper seeks to characterize, and perhaps debunk, the notion of a ldquopower-hungry GPUrdquo via an empirical study of the performance, power, and energy characteristics of GPUs for scientific computing. Specifically, we take an important biological code that runs in a traditional CPU environment and transform and map it to a hybrid CPU+GPU environment. The end result is that our hybrid CPU+GPU environment, hereafter referred to simply as GPU environment, delivers an energy-delay product that is multiple orders of magnitude better than a traditional CPU environment, whether unicore or multicore.},

An example is the line formed by messages awaiting transmission over a crowded communication channel in which urgent messages may take precedence over routine ones. With the passage of time a given unit may move forward in the line owing to the servicing of units at the front of the line or may move back owing to the arrival of units holding higher priorities. Though it does not provide a complete description of this process, the average elapsed time between the arrival in the line of a unit of a given priority and its admission to the facility for servicing is useful in evaluating the procedure by which priority assignments are made. Expressions for this quantity are derived for two cases-the single-channel system in which the unit servicing times are arbitrarily distributed (Eq. 3) and the multiple-channel system in which the servicing times are exponentially distributed (Eq. 6). In both cases it is assumed that arrivals occur at random.},

A review of scheduling research involving setup considerations. \{OMEGA\} The International Journal of Management Sciences 27, 219â€“239], who reviewed the literature since the mid-1960s. Since the appearance of that survey paper, there has been an increasing interest in scheduling problems with setup times (costs) with an average of more than 40 papers per year being added to the literature. The objective of this paper is to provide an extensive review of the scheduling literature on models with setup times (costs) from then to date covering more than 300 papers. Given that so many papers have appeared in a short time, there are cases where different researchers addressed the same problem independently, and sometimes by using even the same technique, e.g., genetic algorithm. Throughout the paper we identify such areas where independently developed techniques need to be compared. The paper classifies scheduling problems into those with batching and non-batching considerations, and with sequence-independent and sequence-dependent setup times. It further categorizes the literature according to shop environments, including single-machine, parallel machines, flow shop, no-wait flow shop, flexible flow shop, job shop, open shop, and others.}

    Abstract = {Reconfigurable computing is a promising technology to meet future computational demand by leveraging flexibilities and the high degree of parallelism found in reconfigurable hardware fabrics, such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).  However, despite their promising performance researchers have demonstrated, reconfigurable computers are yet to be widely adopted.  One reason is the lack of a common and intuitive operating system for these platforms.
				This dissertation work explores the design and implementation trade-offs of an operating system for FPGA-based reconfigurable computers, BORPH, the Berkeley Operating system for ReProgrammable Hardware.  The goal of this work is to explore and demonstrate the feasibility of providing a systematic and easy to understand view into reconfigurable computers through OS support without incurring significant performance penalties.
				BORPH provides kernel support for FPGA applications by extending a standard Linux operating system.  It establishes the notion of hardware process for executing user FPGA applications.  Users therefore compile and execute hardware designs on FPGA resources the same way they run software programs on conventional processor-based systems.  BORPH offers run-time general file system support to hardware processes as if they were software.  The unified file interface allows hardware and software processes to communicate via standard UNIX file pipes.  Furthermore, a virtual file system is built to allow access to memories and registers defined in the FPGA, providing communication links between hardware and software.
				The functions of BORPH are demonstrated on a BEE2 compute module.  Performances of BORPH are measured to identify bottlenecks of our system.  The clean OS kernel/user separation of BORPH has allowed us to improve overall system performance without affecting existing user designs.  Furthermore, BORPH's unified run-time environment has enabled designers to make fair and end-to-end comparisons among software/hardware implementations of the same application.  Most importantly, since the introduction of BORPH to our FPGA-based platform, we have observed increased productivity among high-level application developers who have little experience in FPGA application design.}

Benchmarking results for four RTOSs show no clear winner, with each RTOS performing better on some criteria than others.},
